    2) play framework ( http://downloads.typesafe.com/play/2.1.1/play-2.1.1.zip )
        Installation instructions for play framework: http://www.playframework.com/documentation/2.1.1/Installing

    4) if you don't have it installed, sbt: http://www.scala-sbt.org/
    5) if you don't have it installed: ant:http://ant.apache.org/
    6) pull down the github repo
    7) make sure mysqld is running, log in as root user and run:  Nitro/play/conf/create_db.sql
        This will create the playuser that is used by play to query/write to
        the database.
    8) cd Nitro/play , startup play from the commandline:
        $ play compile && play run &
    9) After a minute or so, play will startup the server.
        Then goto your browser and load up: http://localhost:9000
        Play will tell you that your database is outdated and needs to run an evolution
        this is basically the play ORM (ebeans) asking to create the backend tables
        in the database, click on the run script button.
    10) go back to the commandline and type `cd ../gwt` to goto the gwt folder
    type: $ ant devmode.
    this will launch a gwt popup, in a minute or so, it will load and then you can
    click 'Launch in Default Browser' then a webpage will show up.
    in another tab, goto yelp.com and find a business, in the url there will be
    business id, such as here:  http://www.yelp.com/biz/starbucks-san-jose-67
    copy-paste the 'starbucks-san-jose-67' into the textbox in When2Promote
    then click Submit.
    You're now up and running on Nitro!!!
